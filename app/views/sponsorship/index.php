            <h5 class="text-heading">GUIDELINES</h5>
            <p class="text-paragraph">Here at Rooster Tires we are always looking for athletes to represent our brand. Success has many forms and our ideal riders are both dedicated and respectful. Winning is great, but more importantly to us is good sportsmanship and professionalism.</p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">Unlike most sponsorship programs our savings are up front and are not performance based. Winning to save, managing credits and making huge one-time purchases before you benefit isn’t what we’re about. We are committed to anyone who can throw a leg over their bike and have designed an easy program for every level of rider.</p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">Rooster Tires has put together three programs to further enhance the best valued Tires and Tubes in the industry and to keep premium quality rubber under you for way less than anyone else is offering. Given Rooster Tires are already 30-50% less than competing brands you can ride assured that you have a significant advantage and other riders are not getting the financial support that you are.</p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">The Rooster Tires Sponsorship Program is very simple. You don’t have to wade through complicated sponsorship discounts offering tiny savings or keep track of credits or incentives.  All you need to do is to use your discount code and order when you need to. We really want you to succeed and we know how much time and financial commitment is made every single year you ride. We recognize that our best opportunity to impact you is through meaningful financial support and not based on a combination of your purchases, commitment, contingency rewards and participation etc, etc.</p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">For the rider who mostly rides for fun who just loves to ride and will do the occasional race (or not), we want to be your supplier of choice. If you are a hard charger working your way through the competition, we will help you get there and for those who race among the best we will be your advantage. We’re happy to trade you our support to help tell our story.  </p>
